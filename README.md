# Photon Mapping in Ada 2023

## Project Overview
Photon Mapping is a two-pass global illumination algorithm invented by Henrik Wann Jensen that decouples the representation of illumination from scene geometry. In the first pass, photons are emitted from light sources, traced through the scene via ray-object intersections and Russian roulette scattering, and deposited into a spatial data structure. In the second pass, the scene is rendered by combining ray tracing for direct lighting and specular reflections with nearest-neighbor density estimations from the photon map for caustics, diffuse indirect illumination, and participating media.

## Features
- Complete spatial KD-Tree construction using recursive 3D median-split partitioning.
- Nearest-neighbor radius querying for arbitrary query points in Euclidean space.
- Russian Roulette interaction modeling for diffuse reflection, specular reflection, and absorption.
- Ray-Sphere surface intersection calculations with surface normal generation.
- Three surface radiance density estimation filters:
  - Constant (uniform circle kernel)
  - Linear (cone filter)
  - Gaussian filter
- Volumetric photon mapping density estimation for participating scattering media.
- Multi-component two-pass synthesis combining direct illumination, specular reflection, caustics, and global indirect lighting.
- Pure Ada 2023 strong typing, contract-based programming (`Pre` conditions), and zero-warning compilation under `-gnatwa`.
